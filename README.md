# ❄️ avogadro-genice ❄️

Avogadro2 script to generate hydrogen-disordered ice lattices ❄️

Uses [GenIce2](https://github.com/vitroid/GenIce):

```
pip3 install genice2
```

GenIce is a swiss army knife to generate hydrogen-disordered ice structures,
including:
- a huge variety of lattices
- added noise to disorder position
- support for GROMACS atom typing
- density changes
- generating inclusion structures
- clathrates
- ions
